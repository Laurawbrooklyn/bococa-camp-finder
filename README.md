# **BococaCampFinder**

BococaCampFinder is a web app that helps you find a summer camp for your child in the BoCoCa Neighborhoods of Brooklyn and surrounding areas including: Boerum Hill, Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens, Columbia Street Waterfront and Brooklyn Heights (including camps that offer bus pickups in those neighborhoods).

The app was created based on conversations with several friends (with children) expressing the difficulty they have had when searching for summer camps options in our neighborhood.  I decided to create a database that allows users to search for summer camps by a specific area, age range, type of camp or cost per week, based on feedback from users on what would be most helpful. The camp finder web app also allows users to create a username and password and login to add more camps to the database.
